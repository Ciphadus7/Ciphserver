V1.2

This version is way different than my previous ones. 
I took a different approach as I changed my goals with the server. Running a torrent server was a fun little thing but I mostly lost passion for it
and ventured into other things that i could potentially do with this.
For this version, I wanted to work with a GUI to see how much different it is compared to sticking to a CLI.
For that reason, I installed linux mint on the server. I used the XFCE version to keep the ram usage low. I know using a window manager would've been even
smarter but I don't want to invest a lot of time into those since I'm not really passionate about that.

I stripped all unnecessary stuff from the distro and disabled + masked all useless processes.

For this version, the server solely focuses on Folding - https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en-US
I've kept my resource usage at high and disabled all power manager facilities. It runs 24/7 and has amassed 11,000+ points as of 19th May 2023 - 10:00AM.

My goal for now is to reach 250,000 points. Till then, I'll try to work on another version for the server on a VM on my main machine. I want to continue
folding but I want to optimize it to the max so as to obtain optimal output.

I have still enabled an SSH server for debugging/monitoring.

Came to another conclusion that having multiple users for a homeserver which nobody access except you, and you don't port forward anything, i believe it's still very secure.

For now, the server will continue to fold and i will continue to explore all available options to optimize the server(mostly getting rid of the GUI and going back to a server focused distro)
