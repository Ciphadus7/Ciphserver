Setting up the server:

First I removed all the 'snap' packages and deleted snapd. IMO, they're completely useless. Flatpak and the native package manager are just superior.
Secondly. I disabled and masked the service 'systemd-networkd-wait-online.service' With my hardware, my connection was not identified during intial bootup so i was stuck on this service running for ~2 mins. Not worth it. Disabled it.
Made 3 users. 1)Root user which has access to everything. 2)Another root user that is for trusted users. 3)A normal user with no priveleges [was learning about permissions and who needs to have what.]
AdGuard was a breeze to set up. No complaints here.

Faced an issue with Transmission: Permission denied to access the folders where I'd be strong stuff.

Important thing to note with Jellyfin:
Set the folder permissions so that Jellyfin can access the media files.
```sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/media```


Changed the infrasturcture a bit. Now, I'll only run my tranmission service from 10pm IST to 6AM IST[bandwith hog]

Enabled backups using rsync. My home directory will be snapshotted every night at 10pm. Seems like a good enough backup time.

Encountered a humongous issue with the partition. Out of 492GB available, for some reason the main partition is only using 93GB. Makes absolutely no sense. I think it has something to do with the LVM partition. 
Been trying to fix it but I think the only thing i can do is reinstall the server
